## üîÑ Workflow Guide

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature  # or fix/your-fix
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Commit**
   ```bash
   # Stage changes
   git add .

   # Commit with conventional commit message
   git commit -m "feat(scope): add amazing feature"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix(scope): resolve specific issue"
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   # Create PR to main branch via GitHub UI
   ```

4. **Release Process**
   - Merging to main branch automatically:
     - Updates CHANGELOG.md
     - Creates a new release
     - Updates version numbers
     - Creates GitHub release with assets

### Commit Message Format

Follow the Conventional Commits standard:

```bash
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Adding/updating tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

   - Add `PAT_TOKEN` secret:
     - Generate token at GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
     - Required scopes: `repo`, `write:packages`
   - Configure branch protection rules:
     - Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule
     - Protect `main` branch
     - Require pull request reviews
     - Require status checks to pass

3. **Update Configuration Files**
   - Update `pyproject.toml`:
     ```toml
     [tool.poetry]
     name = "your-project-name"
     version = "1.0.0"
     authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
     ```
   - Update GitHub workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
   - Update repository URLs in documentation

### Workflow Debugging Commands

```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 5

# Watch a specific workflow run
gh run watch

# View workflow run details
gh run view --log

# List failed workflow runs
gh run list --status failed

# Download workflow artifacts
gh run download <run-id>

# View workflow in browser
gh run view --web
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Release Creation Fails**
   - Check PAT_TOKEN permissions
   - Ensure commit messages follow convention
   - Verify branch protection settings
   - Check git configuration:
     ```bash
     git config --list
     gh auth status
     ```

2. **Changelog Not Updating**
   - Only updates on main branch merges
   - Verify commit message format
   - Check workflow logs for errors
   - Ensure PAT_TOKEN has write permissions

3. **Pre-commit Hooks Failing**
   - Update hooks:
     ```bash
     pre-commit clean
     pre-commit autoupdate
     ```
   - Check commit message format
   - Run black manually:
     ```bash
     poetry run black .
     ```

4. **Workflow Permission Issues**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
   - Ensure PAT_TOKEN has required scopes
   - Check workflow permissions in yml files

## üîÑ Semantic Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) principles. Version numbers are structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

1. **MAJOR** version - Incremented for incompatible API changes
2. **MINOR** version - Incremented for backward-compatible new functionality
3. **PATCH** version - Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### Version Bumping Rules

- Breaking changes (MAJOR): `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit footer or `!` after type/scope
- New features (MINOR): `feat:` commit type
- Bug fixes (PATCH): `fix:` commit type
- No version bump: `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`

## üöÄ Python Semantic Release

We use [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for automated versioning and changelog generation. Key features:

- Automatic version bumping based on commit messages
- Changelog generation following Keep a Changelog format
- GitHub release creation and asset publishing
- Support for pre-releases and build metadata

### Configuration

Configuration in `pyproject.toml` integrates our versioning and changelog standards:

```toml
[tool.python_semantic_release]
# Version Management
version_variables = ["app/__init__.py:__version__"]  # Update version in code
version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version"]  # Update version in pyproject.toml
version_source = ["tag", "commit"]  # Determine version from tags and commits
major_on_zero = false  # Follow SemVer for 0.x versions
tag_format = "v{version}"  # Git tag format (e.g., v1.0.0)

# Commit Parsing
commit_parser = "conventional_commits"  # Use Conventional Commits standard
commit_author = "github-actions[bot] <41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>"

# Changelog Management
changelog_file = "CHANGELOG.md"  # Keep a Changelog file
changelog_sections = [  # Keep a Changelog categories
    "feature",    # Maps to Added
    "fix",        # Maps to Fixed
    "breaking",   # Maps to Changed with breaking changes
    "documentation",
    "performance",
    "refactor"
]

# Changelog Behavior
include_unreleased = true  # Track upcoming changes
always_update = true      # Update changelog even without version bump
render_commit_links = true  # Add links to commits
render_title = true        # Include version headers

# Release Settings
upload_to_repository = false
build_command = "poetry build"
tag_type = "annotated"  # Use annotated tags for better documentation
```

### Automatic Standards Compliance

1. **Semantic Versioning**:
   - Analyzes commit messages using Conventional Commits
   - Automatically determines version bumps:
     - `BREAKING CHANGE` ‚Üí MAJOR
     - `feat:` ‚Üí MINOR
     - `fix:` ‚Üí PATCH
   - Creates appropriate Git tags

2. **Keep a Changelog**:
   - Maintains CHANGELOG.md in the standard format
   - Groups changes by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
   - Includes release dates and version links
   - Keeps an Unreleased section for upcoming changes
   - Links to Git comparisons between versions
   - Updates changelog even for non-version-bumping changes
   - Tracks all commits in the Unreleased section
   - Provides complete history of all changes

### Manual Release Commands

```bash
# Check what the next version would be
poetry run semantic-release version --noop

# Create a new version (local only)
poetry run semantic-release version

# Create and publish a new release
poetry run semantic-release publish
```

### Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `GH_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- For fine-grained tokens: `contents` permission required

## üîÑ Changelog Guidelines

We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) principles for maintaining our CHANGELOG.md. This ensures our changelog is:

### Guiding Principles

- Written for humans, not machines
- Easy to link to any section
- One sub-section per version
- List releases in reverse-chronological order
- Include release date for each version
- Group changes by type
- Mention whether we follow Semantic Versioning

### Types of Changes

- `Added` - New features
- `Changed` - Changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated` - Soon-to-be removed features
- `Removed` - Now removed features
- `Fixed` - Any bug fixes
- `Security` - In case of vulnerabilities

### Good Practices

- Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top for tracking upcoming changes
- Never use commit log diffs as changelog entries
- Always write clear, human-friendly descriptions
- Use ISO 8601 format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Make it clear when breaking changes occur
- Keep entries consistent and well-organized
- Link to issues, PRs, and other relevant information

### Automatic Updates

The changelog is automatically updated:
- On merges to the main branch
- Even when changes don't trigger a version bump
- For all types of changes (features, fixes, docs, etc.)
- With links to commits and PRs
- In the "Unreleased" section until a new version is released

Development branches (feature/*, fix/*, develop) don't trigger changelog updates. Changes are collected and added to CHANGELOG.md when merged to main.
