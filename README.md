## üîÑ Workflow Guide

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature  # or fix/your-fix
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Commit**
   ```bash
   # Stage changes
   git add .

   # Commit with conventional commit message
   git commit -m "feat(scope): add amazing feature"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix(scope): resolve specific issue"
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   # Create PR to main branch via GitHub UI
   ```

4. **Release Process**
   - Merging to main branch automatically:
     - Updates CHANGELOG.md
     - Creates a new release
     - Updates version numbers
     - Creates GitHub release with assets

### Commit Message Format

Follow the Angular Commit Message Convention:

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- feat: A new feature (MINOR version bump)
- fix: A bug fix (PATCH version bump)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Breaking Changes:
- Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer
- Or append `!` after type/scope (e.g., `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`)
- Triggers a MAJOR version bump

Examples:
```bash
# Feature with scope
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication

# Bug fix with breaking change
fix!: remove deprecated API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The /v1/api/* endpoints have been removed.

# Documentation update
docs(readme): update installation instructions

# Multiple-line description with scope
feat(api): improve error handling for REST endpoints

Implement better error messages and status codes
for all REST API endpoints.

Closes #123
```

Scope:
- Optional parentheses-enclosed identifier
- Indicates section of codebase (e.g., api, auth, core)
- Should be noun describing the section

Description:
- Imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period (.) at the end

Body:
- Free-form
- Provide context and motivation for changes
- Use imperative, present tense

Footer:
- Reference issues being closed
- Note breaking changes
- Multiple footers allowed
- Format: `token: value` or `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Release Creation Fails**
   - Check workflow permissions in repository settings
   - Ensure commit messages follow convention
   - Verify branch protection settings
   - Check git configuration:
     ```bash
     git config --list
     gh auth status
     ```

2. **Changelog Not Updating**
   - Only updates on main branch merges
   - Verify commit message format
   - Check workflow logs for errors
   - Ensure workflow has write permissions

3. **Pre-commit Hooks Failing**
   - Update hooks:
     ```bash
     pre-commit clean
     pre-commit autoupdate
     ```
   - Check commit message format
   - Run black manually:
     ```bash
     poetry run black .
     ```

4. **Workflow Permission Issues**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
   - Check workflow permissions in yml files
   - Ensure proper permissions are set in workflow files

## üîÑ Semantic Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) principles. Version numbers are structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

1. **MAJOR** version - Incremented for incompatible API changes
2. **MINOR** version - Incremented for backward-compatible new functionality
3. **PATCH** version - Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### Version Bumping Rules

- Breaking changes (MAJOR): `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit footer or `!` after type/scope
- New features (MINOR): `feat:` commit type
- Bug fixes (PATCH): `fix:` commit type
- No version bump: `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`

## üöÄ Python Semantic Release

We use [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for automated versioning and changelog generation. Key features:

- Automatic version bumping based on commit messages
- Changelog generation following Keep a Changelog format
- GitHub release creation and asset publishing
- Support for pre-releases and build metadata

### Configuration

Configuration in `pyproject.toml` integrates our versioning and changelog standards:

```toml
[tool.python_semantic_release]
# Version Management
version_variables = ["app/__init__.py:__version__"]  # Update version in code
version_toml = ["pyproject.toml:tool.poetry.version"]  # Update version in pyproject.toml
version_source = ["tag", "commit"]  # Determine version from tags and commits
major_on_zero = false  # Follow SemVer for 0.x versions
tag_format = "v{version}"  # Git tag format (e.g., v1.0.0)

# Commit Parsing
commit_parser = "conventional_commits"  # Use Conventional Commits standard
commit_author = "github-actions[bot] <41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>"

# Changelog Management
changelog_file = "CHANGELOG.md"  # Keep a Changelog file
changelog_sections = [  # Keep a Changelog categories
    "feature",    # Maps to Added
    "fix",        # Maps to Fixed
    "breaking",   # Maps to Changed with breaking changes
    "documentation",
    "performance",
    "refactor"
]

# Release Settings
upload_to_repository = false
build_command = "poetry build"
tag_type = "annotated"  # Use annotated tags for better documentation
```

### Automatic Standards Compliance

1. **Semantic Versioning**:
   - Analyzes commit messages using Conventional Commits
   - Automatically determines version bumps:
     - `BREAKING CHANGE` ‚Üí MAJOR
     - `feat:` ‚Üí MINOR
     - `fix:` ‚Üí PATCH
   - Creates appropriate Git tags

2. **Keep a Changelog**:
   - Maintains CHANGELOG.md in the standard format
   - Groups changes by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
   - Includes release dates and version links
   - Keeps an Unreleased section for upcoming changes
   - Links to Git comparisons between versions

### Manual Release Commands

```bash
# Check what the next version would be
poetry run semantic-release version --noop

# Create a new version (local only)
poetry run semantic-release version

# Create and publish a new release
poetry run semantic-release publish
```

### Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `GH_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- For fine-grained tokens: `contents` permission required

## üîÑ Changelog Guidelines

We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) principles for maintaining our CHANGELOG.md. This ensures our changelog is:

### Guiding Principles

- Written for humans, not machines
- Easy to link to any section
- One sub-section per version
- List releases in reverse-chronological order
- Include release date for each version
- Group changes by type
- Mention whether we follow Semantic Versioning

### Types of Changes

- `Added` - New features
- `Changed` - Changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated` - Soon-to-be removed features
- `Removed` - Now removed features
- `Fixed` - Any bug fixes
- `Security` - In case of vulnerabilities

### Good Practices

- Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top for tracking upcoming changes
- Never use commit log diffs as changelog entries
- Always write clear, human-friendly descriptions
- Use ISO 8601 format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Make it clear when breaking changes occur
- Keep entries consistent and well-organized
- Link to issues, PRs, and other relevant information

### Example Entry

```markdown
## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-02

### Workflow Files Structure

1. **CI Workflow** (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
   - Main orchestrator workflow
   - Triggers on push to main and pull requests
   - Controls the release process
   - Uses reusable workflows for setup, lint, and test

2. **Setup Workflow** (.github/workflows/setup-python.yml)
   - Sets up Python environment
   - Installs and configures Poetry
   - Creates and caches virtual environment
   - Shares environment via artifacts

3. **Lint Workflow** (.github/workflows/lint.yml)
   - Runs Black code formatter
   - Validates commit messages with Commitlint
   - Uses shared virtual environment

4. **Test Workflow** (.github/workflows/test.yml)
   - Runs pytest with coverage
   - Uses shared virtual environment
   - Reports test results

### Workflow Execution

1. **Setup Phase:**
   - Initializes Python 3.11 environment
   - Installs Poetry and dependencies
   - Creates virtual environment
   - Caches dependencies for speed
   - Shares environment via artifacts

2. **Parallel Checks:**
   - Lint and Test jobs run concurrently
   - Both use the shared virtual environment
   - All checks must pass to proceed

3. **Release Phase (Main Branch Only):**
   - Triggered on push to main
   - Uses python-semantic-release
   - Updates CHANGELOG.md
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Publishes release assets

### Skip Conditions

Workflow skips release when:
- Commit is from github-actions[bot]
- Commit message contains:
  - [skip ci]
  - chore(release)
- Event is a pull request

### Security and Permissions

- Uses built-in GITHUB_TOKEN
- Minimal required permissions per job:
  - Lint: read (contents, pull-requests)
  - Test: read (contents), write (checks)
  - Release: write (contents, id-token)

### Environment Optimization

- Shared virtual environment via artifacts
- Poetry for dependency management
- Cached dependencies:
  - Poetry virtual environment
  - Pip cache
  - Poetry package cache
- Preserved environment across jobs
